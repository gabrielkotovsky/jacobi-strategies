**FINANCIAL AND MODELING ASSUMPTIONS**

*Note: Basic data structure and API endpoint assumptions are documented in README.md*

## **IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS**

### **Portfolio Construction**
- Portfolio weights must sum to 1.0 (±1e-6 tolerance for floating point precision)
- Equal-weight portfolios are generated automatically if no weights provided
- Asset count is dynamic and determined by loaded data (currently 25 assets)

### **Rebalancing Strategies**
- **Periodic**: Weights reset to target allocation each period, no transaction costs
- **Buy-and-Hold**: Initial weights applied at t=0, weights drift based on performance
- Weight evolution: `new_weight = (old_weight * cumulative_return) / sum(all_weights * cumulative_returns)`

### **Risk Metrics**
- Volatility calculated using sample standard deviation (ddof=1)
- Maximum drawdown calculated as percentage decline from peak
- Risk-free rate (RFR) is unconstrained finite float (default: 0.0)
- Minimum acceptable return (MAR) is unconstrained finite float (default: 0.0)

### **Annualization**
- Mean returns annualized by multiplying by periods_per_year
- Volatility annualized by multiplying by √periods_per_year
- Default assumes annual data (periods_per_year = 1.0)
- Supports monthly (12.0), daily (252.0), or custom periods

### **Data Quality**
- All returns must be finite (no NaN or infinite values)
- Asset names must be unique and non-empty strings
- Category mappings must be complete (no missing assets)
- All assets denominated in same currency (assumed USD)

## **MODELING LIMITATIONS**

### **Market Assumptions**
- No market microstructure effects
- Perfect liquidity (can trade any amount at market prices)
- No bid-ask spreads or market impact
- Continuous trading (no market closures or gaps)

### **Portfolio Constraints**
- No leverage constraints (weights can sum to 1.0)
- No sector or concentration limits
- No minimum position sizes
- No maximum position sizes beyond 100%

### **Risk Management**
- No VaR or CVaR calculations implemented yet
- No stress testing or scenario analysis
- No correlation or covariance matrix utilization
- No factor model decomposition

## **COMPUTATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS**

### **Performance**
- Vectorized NumPy operations for efficiency
- Memory-mapped HDF5 data for large datasets
- Single-threaded processing (no parallelization)
- Deterministic results (same inputs = same outputs)

### **Precision**
- Float16 precision for returns data (sufficient for financial calculations)
- Float64 precision for portfolio calculations
- Tolerance of 1e-6 for weight sum validation
- Tolerance of 1e-10 for cumulative return validation

## **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)**

### **Advanced Risk Metrics**
- VaR and CVaR calculations
- Downside deviation and Sortino ratio
- Information ratio and tracking error
- Maximum drawdown duration

### **Portfolio Optimization**
- Mean-variance optimization
- Risk parity allocation
- Black-Litterman model
- Factor-based allocation

### **Transaction Costs**
- Bid-ask spreads
- Commission structures
- Market impact modeling
- Rebalancing cost optimization
